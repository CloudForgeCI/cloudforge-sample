# PCI-DSS Compliance Guide for CloudForge CI

## IMPORTANT: Scope and Limitations

**CloudForge CI provides infrastructure controls only. This is NOT full PCI-DSS compliance.**

### What This Gives You:
- Infrastructure-level security controls aligned with PCI-DSS v3.2.1
- Automated validation during deployment
- Evidence collection for infrastructure requirements
- AWS services configured per PCI-DSS best practices

### What You Still Need:
- **Application-level controls** - See [PCI_DSS_APPLICATION_SECURITY.md](PCI_DSS_APPLICATION_SECURITY.md)
- **Organizational policies** - Security policy, incident response, acceptable use, etc.
- **Procedures** - Change management, access reviews, vulnerability management
- **Training** - Security awareness training for all personnel
- **Assessment** - Validation by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)
- **Documentation** - Risk assessments, network diagrams, data flow diagrams

**You cannot achieve PCI-DSS compliance with infrastructure alone.** This guide shows you how to configure the infrastructure foundations. Full compliance requires organizational controls and QSA validation.

## Automated PCI-DSS Validation

CloudForge CI includes comprehensive **PCI-DSS validation rules** that automatically enforce compliance requirements for production environments processing cardholder data.

The system automatically validates **12 PCI-DSS requirements** during deployment:

| Requirement | Control | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Req 1 | Firewall & Network Segmentation | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 2 | Secure Configurations | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 3 | Encryption at Rest | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 4 | Encryption in Transit | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 6.6 | Web Application Firewall | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 7 | Access Control | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 8 | Authentication & MFA | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 10 | Audit Logging | ✅ Automated Validation |
| Req 11 | Security Monitoring | ✅ Automated Validation |

**Implementation:** [`PciDssRules.java`](../../cloudforge-api/src/main/java/com/cloudforgeci/api/core/rules/PciDssRules.java)

The validation automatically runs for **PRODUCTION security profiles** only.

---

## Overview

This guide covers deploying CloudForge CI for environments that **process, store, or transmit cardholder data**. It assumes your Jenkins infrastructure will be part of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).

---

## Quick Start: Infrastructure Deployment

### Minimum Required Configuration

```json
{
  "securityProfile": "production",
  "tier": "production",
  "networkMode": "private-with-nat",
  "authMode": "alb-oidc",
  "ssoInstanceArn": "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-xxxxxxxxxxxx",

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] AWS account has AWS Audit Manager enabled
- [ ] AWS SSO configured with MFA enforced
- [ ] Domain and TLS certificate available
- [ ] Network architecture planned (CDE segmentation)
- [ ] Reviewed PCI-DSS requirements above

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd cfc-testing
mvn clean install

# Interactive deployment with PCI-DSS options
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--interactive"
```

Or use deployment context JSON:

```bash
# Create pci-dss-deployment.json
cat > pci-dss-deployment.json << 'EOF'
{
  "securityProfile": "production",
  "tier": "production",
  "networkMode": "private-with-nat",
  "authMode": "alb-oidc",
  "ssoInstanceArn": "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "ssoGroupId": "your-sso-group-uuid",
  "ssoTargetAccountId": "123456789012",
  "wafEnabled": true,
  "awsConfigEnabled": true,
  "auditManagerEnabled": true,
  "auditManagerFrameworkId": "PCI-DSS",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "subdomain": "jenkins-prod",
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
EOF

# Deploy
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--deployment-context=pci-dss-deployment.json"
```

### Step 3: Validate PCI-DSS Controls

The system automatically validates PCI-DSS controls during deployment:

```
=== PCI-DSS Validation Results ===

✓ Network Security (Req 1)
✓ Encryption at Rest (Req 3)
✓ Encryption in Transit (Req 4)
✓ WAF Protection (Req 6.6)
✓ Authentication (Req 8)
✓ Audit Logging (Req 10)
✓ Security Monitoring (Req 11)

VALIDATION PASSED: All infrastructure controls enabled
```

If validation fails, you'll see specific errors:

```
❌ PCI-DSS Req 1.3: Public network mode prohibited for cardholder data environment.
   Use 'private-with-nat' for production systems processing card data.

❌ PCI-DSS Req 8.2: Authentication must be enabled for production environments.
   Configure authMode='alb-oidc' or 'jenkins-oidc' with MFA-enabled identity provider.
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Configuration

1. **Configure Jenkins Security**:
   ```
   - Change admin password
   - Enable Matrix Authorization
   - Install security plugins
   - Configure OIDC authentication
   - Disable unnecessary features
   ```

2. **Enable AWS Audit Manager**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to AWS Audit Manager console
   # Review the PCI-DSS assessment
   # Verify evidence collection is working
   aws auditmanager get-assessment --assessment-id <id>
   ```

3. **Configure Monitoring Alerts**:
   ```bash
   # Subscribe to SNS topics for security alerts
   aws sns subscribe \
     --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:security-alerts-production \
     --protocol email \
     --notification-endpoint security-team@example.com
   ```

### Step 5: Document the Environment

Create the following documentation:

1. **System Architecture Diagram**:
   - Network topology
   - Data flow diagram
   - CDE boundaries

2. **Data Flow Documentation**:
   - Where cardholder data enters the system
   - How it's processed
   - Where it's stored
   - When it's deleted

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - All infrastructure as code (CDK)
   - Configuration baselines
   - Change control process

2. **AWS Config**: Resource configurations, compliance status
3. **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic patterns
4. **CloudWatch Logs**: Application logs, security events
5. **GuardDuty**: Threat detection findings
6. **WAF Logs**: Web attack attempts

### Manual Evidence Required

1. **Policies and Procedures**:
   - Information security policy
   - Acceptable use policy
   - Incident response plan
   - Change management procedures

2. **Training Records**:
   - Security awareness training completion
   - Training materials

3. **Testing Reports**:
   - Quarterly vulnerability scans
   - Annual penetration test reports

4. **Reviews**:
   - Quarterly access reviews
   - Annual policy reviews
   - Risk assessments

---

## Troubleshooting

### Validation Errors

**Error**: "Public network mode prohibited for cardholder data environment"
```bash
# Solution: Update networkMode in deployment context
"networkMode": "private-with-nat"
```

**Error**: "Authentication must be enabled for production environments"
```bash
# Solution: Configure SSO authentication
"authMode": "alb-oidc",
"ssoInstanceArn": "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-xxxx",
"ssoGroupId": "your-group-id",
"ssoTargetAccountId": "123456789012"
```

**Error**: "WAF strongly recommended for production"
```bash
# Solution: Enable WAF
"wafEnabled": true
```

**Error**: "Log retention must be at least 365 days"
```bash
# Solution: The production profile defaults to 2 years (730 days)
# This should not fail unless manually overridden
# Ensure you're using securityProfile: "production"
```

### AWS Audit Manager Not Collecting Evidence

1. **Enable Audit Manager**:
   ```bash
   aws auditmanager register-account --kms-key <key-id>
   ```

2. **Configure Data Sources**:
   - CloudTrail must be enabled
   - AWS Config must be enabled
   - Security Hub (optional but recommended)

3. **Check IAM Permissions**:
   - Audit Manager role needs read access to CloudTrail, Config, Security Hub

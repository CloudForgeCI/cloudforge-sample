# ApplicationSpec Compliance Requirements

This document outlines compliance considerations for CloudForge ApplicationSpecs across various regulatory frameworks.

## Compliance Framework Overview

CloudForge supports the following compliance frameworks:
- **SOC 2** - Service Organization Control 2 (Trust Services Criteria)
- **PCI-DSS** - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **HIPAA** - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulation
- **FERPA** - Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act

## Applications with Compliance Requirements

### Databases (HIGH COMPLIANCE RISK)

#### PostgreSQL ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: ALL (SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, FERPA)

**Why**: Databases store sensitive data including:
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- Protected Health Information (PHI) - HIPAA
- Payment Card Data - PCI-DSS
- Customer data - SOC2, GDPR
- Student records - FERPA

**Required Controls**:
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: EFS/EBS encryption (automatic in CloudForge)
- ✅ **Encryption in Transit**: SSL/TLS connections required
- ⚠️ **Access Control**: Strong passwords, no defaults
- ⚠️ **Audit Logging**: Enable PostgreSQL audit extension (pgAudit)
- ⚠️ **Backup/Retention**: Automated backups with retention policies
- ⚠️ **Data Masking**: Required for non-production environments
- ⚠️ **Network Isolation**: Private subnets only for production

**PCI-DSS Specific** (Storing cardholder data):
- Req 3.4: Encryption of cardholder data
- Req 3.5.1: Restrict access to cryptographic keys
- Req 8.2: Multi-factor authentication for administrators
- Req 10.2: Audit trail for all access to cardholder data

**HIPAA Specific** (Storing PHI):
- §164.312(a)(2)(iv): Encryption and decryption
- §164.312(b): Audit controls
- §164.312(c)(1): Integrity controls
- §164.312(d): Person or entity authentication

**Implementation**:
```java
// CloudForge automatically handles:
// - EFS encryption at rest ✓
// - Security groups for network isolation ✓
// - CloudWatch audit logging ✓

// User must configure:
// - Strong passwords (use AWS Secrets Manager)
// - SSL/TLS connections
// - Database-level audit logging (pgAudit)
```

---

#### Redis ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: ALL (when storing sensitive data)

**Why**: Often used for:
- Session storage (PII, authentication tokens)
- Cache for sensitive data
- Message queues with customer data

**Required Controls**:
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: EFS/EBS encryption
- ✅ **Authentication**: Password required (default: changeme - MUST change!)
- ⚠️ **Encryption in Transit**: Enable TLS mode
- ⚠️ **Key Expiration**: Set TTLs for sensitive data
- ⚠️ **Network Isolation**: Private subnets only

**PCI-DSS Considerations**:
- Session tokens are considered "sensitive authentication data"
- Redis must NOT store unencrypted cardholder data
- If used for caching, implement key expiration

**HIPAA Considerations**:
- PHI in cache must be encrypted and expire quickly
- Access logs required for audit trails

---

### Version Control Systems (MEDIUM-HIGH COMPLIANCE RISK)

#### GitLab ⚠️ **MEDIUM-HIGH RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: SOC2, GDPR, FERPA (HIPAA/PCI-DSS if storing regulated code)

**Why**: Source code repositories may contain:
- Secrets/credentials accidentally committed
- Personally identifiable information (PII) in code/comments
- Customer data in test fixtures
- Proprietary algorithms and business logic

**Required Controls**:
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: EFS/EBS encryption
- ⚠️ **Access Control**: Strong authentication (SSO/MFA recommended)
- ⚠️ **Audit Logging**: Enable GitLab audit events
- ⚠️ **Secret Scanning**: Enable secret detection
- ⚠️ **Branch Protection**: Protect main branches
- ⚠️ **Code Review**: Required for compliance-sensitive repos

**SOC2 CC6.1** (Logical Access):
- Implement MFA for all users
- Regular access reviews
- Disable inactive accounts

**GDPR Article 32** (Security of Processing):
- Data breach notification capability
- Access logs for user data
- Right to erasure (delete user accounts/data)

---

#### Gitea ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: SOC2, GDPR, FERPA

**Similar requirements to GitLab** but lighter weight:
- Encryption at rest ✓
- Strong authentication required
- Enable built-in access logging
- Regular security updates

---

### CI/CD Systems (MEDIUM COMPLIANCE RISK)

#### Jenkins ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: SOC2, PCI-DSS (if building payment systems), HIPAA (if deploying healthcare apps)

**Why**: CI/CD systems have access to:
- Source code repositories
- Cloud credentials (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Deployment secrets
- Build artifacts
- Production environments

**Required Controls**:
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: EFS/EBS encryption
- ⚠️ **Credential Management**: Use Credentials Plugin with encryption
- ⚠️ **Access Control**: Role-based access (Matrix Authorization)
- ⚠️ **Audit Logging**: Enable Audit Trail plugin
- ⚠️ **Build Isolation**: Separate agents for prod/non-prod
- ⚠️ **Artifact Scanning**: Security scanning before deployment

**PCI-DSS Req 6.3.2**:
- Secure code review before production
- Separation of dev/test from production
- Code change tracking and approval

**SOC2 CC8.1** (Change Management):
- Approval required for production deployments
- Rollback capability
- Audit trail of all changes

---

#### GitLab CI/CD (included in GitLab)
**Same compliance requirements as GitLab VCS** plus:
- Runner isolation
- Secret masking in logs
- Protected variables for production

---

#### Drone ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: SOC2

**Similar to Jenkins**:
- Secret management required
- Build isolation
- Audit logging

---

### Monitoring Systems (LOW-MEDIUM COMPLIANCE RISK)

#### Grafana ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: SOC2, HIPAA (if displaying PHI metrics)

**Why**: Dashboards may display:
- System metrics with customer identifiers
- Application logs with PII
- Security monitoring data

**Required Controls**:
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: EFS/EBS encryption
- ⚠️ **Access Control**: Enable authentication (not anonymous)
- ⚠️ **Data Minimization**: Don't display PII/PHI in dashboards
- ⚠️ **Audit Logging**: Track dashboard access

**SOC2 A1.2** (Monitoring):
- Grafana is a monitoring control itself
- Access to monitoring data must be restricted
- Alerts for security events

---

#### Prometheus ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM RISK**
**Compliance Frameworks**: SOC2

**Why**: Metrics collection for monitoring

**Required Controls**:
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: EFS/EBS encryption
- ⚠️ **Network Isolation**: Not publicly accessible
- ⚠️ **Data Retention**: Define retention policies
- ⚠️ **Label Security**: Don't include PII in metric labels

## Compliance Validation

CloudForge provides built-in compliance validation rules:

```java
// Example: PCI-DSS Rules for databases
if (topology == TopologyType.DATABASE_SERVICE &&
    complianceFrameworks.contains("PCI-DSS")) {
    // Enforce:
    // - Encryption at rest ✓ (automatic)
    // - Private subnets only ✓ (enforced)
    // - Audit logging enabled ✓ (automatic)
    // - Strong password policy ⚠️ (user configures)
    // - Network isolation ✓ (security groups)
}
```

## Recommendations by Use Case
